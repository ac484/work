## Angular Development Principles

- Use signals for state management
- Use @if/@for for all control flow
- Implement OnPush change detection
- Use TypeScript strict mode, never use any type
- Maintain flat file structure
- Implement only what is needed now
- One responsibility per file/component

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Not using signals for state
- Using *ngIf/*ngFor instead of @if/@for
- Over-abstraction
- Using any type
- Custom UI components when Material components exist
- Excessive file/component splitting
- Future-proofing with unused fields
